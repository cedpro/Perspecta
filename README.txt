Run the server first in order to get the proper value.
The Main method in the Main.java will run the server properly.
Maven build will create a useable Jar file that starts the server in the background, CLient wont run properly without server running.

Run the Client through the Main method of the Main.java class as well.
The jar file will be able to run the Client also.
Jar files created through Maven do not work, Exported executable Jar through eclipse work.
